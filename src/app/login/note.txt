DATA BININDING IN ANGULAR
...........................

ts file >> Component
html file >> View


1.  ONE WAY BININDING
    a) Component to View
        - String interpollation  - Operator {{}}       {{data}}
        - Property binding       - [propert]="value"       [placeholder]="data"

    b) View to component
        - Event binding         - (event_name)="fun/method name()"          -(click)="login()"
        - Event binding using '$event'            (eventname)="methodname($event)"
        - event biniding using template rendering variable #variable

2.  TWO WAY BINDING 
    a) ngmodel              [(ngmodel)]="value"
                    FormsModule(has to be imported-3rd party library)


REDIRECTION IN ANGULAR
...............................

navigateByUrl       -   method used to Redirection
router              -   class
AppRoutingModule    -   Module


    ***** Dependency Injection *****
    ----------------------------------
    >>>  to use a method of one class in another class
        >>  the step is performed inside a constructor
    
    To use the method of Router class inside another class we need to perform Dependency Injection ,
    for this we need to use Access Specifier(there is 2 - public and private)

        Syntax -   constructor(private router:Router) { }
                -   router - variable name
                -   Router - Class containing the method , declared with private access specifier

                access specifier variable : Classname



    Angualr Services
..........................

Services can be accessed by any component

while creating a component - a folder will be created along with 4 files-html,css,ts and ts config
whereas while creating Service , automaticaly folder will not be created, we need to create it (near to the component folders in 'app folder')
it will have 2 files- ts & ts config


>> inside the folder, in terminal  >> 
                   command      :         ng g s Servicename       // creates a service
